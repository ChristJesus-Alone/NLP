Assessment Project Brief:  Data Science (NLP) internship

Task : Text Generation

Description: You are given a dataset of tweets from a particular user. Your task is to build a machine learning model to generate new tweets based on the user's existing tweets.

Dataset: You can use the Twitter API to collect tweets from a user of your choice. Alternatively, you can use a pre-collected dataset such as the "Sentiment140 dataset" available on Kaggle:
\https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140

Requirements:

Use a Python programming language to build your model
Use natural language processing techniques to preprocess the data (e.g. remove stop words, punctuation, and perform stemming/lemmatization)
Use a machine learning algorithm of your choice to train the model
Implement a text generation algorithm that takes a seed sentence as input and generates a new tweet based on the patterns learned from the existing tweets
Evaluate the performance of the text generation algorithm using human evaluation and/or automatic evaluation metrics (e.g. perplexity, BLEU score, or ROUGE score)
Deliverables:

A Jupyter notebook with your Python code and the results of your analysis
A brief report explaining your approach and discussing the results
